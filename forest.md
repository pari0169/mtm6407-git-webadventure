# Into the Forest

Hedgehog walks deeper into the forest, carrying a small basket.  
The trees sway gently, and the ground is scattered with red apples and mushrooms.  
One by one, Hedgehog gathers them, humming a little tune.  

Soon the basket is full, and Hedgehog wonders:  
should these treasures be exchanged with the Woodcutter for building supplies?  
Or should Hedgehog keep them for food, just in case the winter comes early?

What will Hedgehog do next?

- [Keep the harvest for food and return home](home.md)  
The air smells of pine, and Hedgehog feels both excited and a little nervous.
